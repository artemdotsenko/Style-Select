# Style Select

Fancy select aims to provide complete control over select box styling.  Since Select Box's are native OS, the styling options are (understandably) limited

## How does it work?

Style Select works by hiding the native select and inserting an unordered list after it.  The unordered list has most of the functionality f a native select, but is completely stylable. You can style the new select in the external stylesheet

## Features?

Not many. Not all of the functionality of a standard select is transferred across and theres very little configuration options. I've built this precisely to my needs, so if i didnt need a feature, I didnt build it.
